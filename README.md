# Contacts-Manager
This program is a real-world tool that would be used to manage contacts like we do on our phones. 

**Side Note:** To make this program work, the directory of the "contacts for one of my projects" folder needs to be changed in the code.

This was an entertaining project to build because it is a useful tool that manipulates and stores data that can be retrieved and used. Also, it is a tool that is currently used by everyone so it makes it a more fulfilling proejct than others. In the future, a GUI might be added to make it visually appealing.
